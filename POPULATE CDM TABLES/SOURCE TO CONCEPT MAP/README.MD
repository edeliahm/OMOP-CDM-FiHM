## Description
The source to concept map table is recommended for use in ETL processes to maintain local source codes which are not available as Concepts in the Standardized Vocabularies, and to establish mappings for each source code into a Standard Concept as __target_concept_ids__ that can be used to populate the Common Data Model tables.
